# better-dad

Welcome to Better Dad!

Being a dad is amazing and enriches your life! But just like many things worth doing in life, you do it for a long time, day after day. This can lead to moments of boredom, frustration, and depression as you try to navigate family life and work life. This can be a difficult feeling for dads to feel as it can sometimes feel like society looks down upon these feelings and we should be "putting our kids first". I will tell you from personal experience and those of friends that you are a better parent when you feel like you are mentally in a good place.

This application was created to help dads become more productive and enjoy embracing being a dad. This project was inspired by a TED talk that I listened to about how Jane McGonigal fought severe depression by treating her life like a game to get little wins and progress through challenging times and emotions.
